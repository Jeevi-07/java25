GIT - version control system

SDLC- 3/4 months
Agile - 1/2 week - development + no operations
DevOps - 1 day

cloud native native application = micro service + containerized + cloud + Devops culture (CICD)

				springboot	    Docker    AWS/Azure/GCP

DevOps - developer(plan /code / build/ test) + operations(release/deploy/operate/monitor)

	- quality + speed
	- automation
		
GIT -> Jenkins(server) -> sonar cube (testing) -> artifactory(different version of code) - CI

main tools?

1. version control system
2. build tools
3. configuration management tool etc

client meeting day1
design code
developer created code - v1.0

client meeting day2
design code
developer created code - v2.0

...


1. version control system
			- software configuration management/ source code management

need - to store different versions

Types - 1. centralized VCS - small startups
	drawback -  cannot save code if network gone, wire, dealing with big data
	ex - SVN, CVS, Perforce

	2. distributed VCS- GIT, fossil etc
	- each developer has its own workspace and local repository
	- all versions are maintained in local repository
	data is ready - push
	from global to local	-pull


GIT - created by Linux Torvalds
	- commit code in local repository

GIT BASH
1. pwd
2. cd c:/mycode
3. git init myrepo  //local repo
4. cd myrepo
5. git clone link //clone repo  - pull
6. //global repo    -push
	- git status
	- git add .
	- git commit -m "class free code"
	- git push origin master
